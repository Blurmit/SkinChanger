# SkinChanger

SkinChanger is a plugin that simply allows players to change their skins.

## NOTICE

This plugin is very experimental. It will only work with the 1.16.5 version of Minecraft. I will add support for other versions in the future.

## Basic Intallation:
* Download the the jar, found [here](https://github.com/Blurmit/SkinChanger/releases).
* Place the jar into it's respective plugin folder.
* Restart the server.
* Done :D

## Changing Skins:
* Run `/skin <skin>` to only change your skin (Skin must be a registered Minecraft account).
* To change other players skin's run `/skin <skin> [player]`.
* Done!

## Download
